We get super excited for every idea we hear, so please explain why you think the feature is needed in as much detail as possible so we can open it up for discussion.

To create a PR, please fork the [repository](https://github.com/thefullstackgroup/webapp), make your changes and create a new pull request if you want to make an update.
