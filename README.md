  <h3>Discover and connect with developers sharing their work.</h3>

Welcome to The Full Stack codebase, the platform that powers
[thefullstack.network](https://thefullstack.network). We are so excited to
have you here. With your help, we can build out the vision of The Full
Stack to better serve it's members.

## What is The Full Stack?

The Full Stack is a community of software developers who share their work,
contribute and give feedback, connect to other developers and teams and build
a network of true value.

There is a global shortage of 40 million developers worldwide, yet 10.2
million still get overlooked. We, as developers, love solving problems
and building software. But we're not good at selling ourselves.
Developers, very often, undersell themselves on paper. A resume filter
has an inherent bias toward good academic credentials, yet 64% of the
global developer population are self-taught, without the "suited"
academic credentials. We are typically discovered through who you work
for or who you know, BUT not for what you can build.

Frustrated with how developers get discovered and get connected to other
developers and teams, we wanted to make this easier and simpler with a
better experience for all.

Opportunity comes around when you expand your network. We believe in the
power of building your own network. We believe showing off what you can
build and expressing your story yields results. And importantly, we
believe in human connection, resulting in a better and more inclusive
experience for all. We've built a platform centred around community and
the belief that showing off what you can build will help you grow your
network and make your best career moves.

We named it _The Full Stack_.

## The Full Stack projects

The Full Stack platform consists of a React (NextJS) webapp that connects to
many different microservices, such as a projects service, profile service, search
service, connections service etc. to name a few. There are also integrations with
third parties such as Firebase (for auth), Firestore, Knock (notifications) and
many cloud functions. Currently, we have made the webapp open source. We are in
the process of creating The Full Stack API platform for developers to build their
own apps on top of The Full Stack API.
